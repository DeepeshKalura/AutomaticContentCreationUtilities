## Automatic Content Creation Utilities
When working in computer science, it is possible to create tangible evidence of your work, referred to as "proof of work" when done concisely by a programmer.
Programmers who use this concept are called shining programmers.

### **Flow:**
Use my personal computer to create a project, push code to Github, and publish a blog post on Medium and LinkedIn.



#### **Issues:**
1. **Lost Trust from LinkedIn:**
   - *Solution:* Explore alternative platforms such as Reddit and Twitter for publishing work. Consider utilizing YouTube as an additional medium.

2. **Medium vs. Personal Website:**
   - *Solution:* Develop a personal website to serve as a comprehensive portfolio. Implement an event system on the website that automatically updates on Medium or other relevant platforms.

3. **GitHub Repository Management:**
   - *Solution:* Create a personalized repository management system to enhance organization and filtering of repositories, mitigating the impact of irrelevant or low-quality repositories.

4. **Lack of "Proof of Work":**
   - *Solution:* Streamline manual processes to facilitate the efficient creation of "Proof of Work" for projects. Implement measures to ensure that evidence of contributions is readily available.
