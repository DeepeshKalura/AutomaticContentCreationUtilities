## Automatic Content Creation Utilities
There is the concept of "Proof of work" in which whatever we say we have a some kind of work which we have to provide a prove 
for that i was using linkdein github and medium.

### Flow
1. I created the project 
2. That project i do certain work
this work should be documented and send in the form too linkdein, medium and github, but the this the manual process. 


### Issue 

The process start with that i was creating a project and something intersecting action to my personal computer. Sincem I am doing my work this work
should be used as the proof but many of my all the works is not been be converted as proof. 

1. All the works that i do in my pc has not been converted to the proof 


### Resolving Idea
I am thinking to create a cli utilites that will have cli seesion has my input and get a .md file as output in my storage with the session name
